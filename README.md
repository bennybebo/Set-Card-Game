## How to Play

The Set Game is a basic implementation of the Set card game. The goal is to find sets of three cards that satisfy the following conditions: A "set" consists of three cards in which each feature is either the same on each card or is different on each card.  That is to say, any feature in the "set"  of three cards in either common to all the cards or is different on each card.

Additional features in this game include a hint button, time tracker, and a 2-player mode. The hint button provides players with two cards that form a correct pair, helping them find the third card. The time tracker keeps track of the time elapsed during the game. In 2-player mode, 2 players can play the game at the same time and compete for the highest score.
